  MindlessTyper

</h1>

Small text editor that encorages you to write instead of constantly editing your document (this app is [Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io/) clone)

## Goals:
1. Learn more about Rust and [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)
2. At the time of the writing original [app](https://enso.sonnet.io/) doesn't have support for Windows, so I've decided to recreate this app for my personal usage
